This function moves soil from `body_soil` at position (`ii`, `jj`) to the `terrain` at
position (`ii_n`, `jj_n`).
It is assumed that the required amount of soil is present on the bucket at the specifed
location, and that there is no bucket walls interfering with the avalanching soil.

# Note
- This function is intended for internal use only.
- By default, all available soil is moved to the terrain.

# Inputs
- `out::SimOut{Int64,Float64}`: Struct that stores simulation outputs.
- `ii::Int64`: Index of the avalanching soil position in the X direction.
- `jj::Int64`: Index of the avalanching soil position in the Y direction.
- `ind::Int64`: Index of the avalanching soil layer.
- `ii_n::Int64`: Index of the new soil position in the X direction.
- `jj_n::Int64`: Index of the new soil position in the Y direction.
- `grid::GridParam{Int64,Float64}`: Struct that stores information related to the
                                    simulation grid.
- `tol::Float64`: Small number used to handle numerical approximation errors.

# Outputs
- None

# Example
